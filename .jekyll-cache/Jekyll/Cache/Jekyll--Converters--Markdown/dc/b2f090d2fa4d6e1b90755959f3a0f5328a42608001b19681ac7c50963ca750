<p>This is a re-upload for the Swing Traffic Generator. Its official homepage is located <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kvishwanath/Swing/"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The swing traffic generator is a tool used in the publication <em>Swing: Realistic and Responsive Network Traffic Generation</em>. But the original source code has a compilation error, and I fixed it.</p>

<p>I tried to contact the author some times by email, but with no response. If the author, or anyone related with the project find this repository, please, contact me.</p>

<p>Since the Author <a href="AUTHORS"><strong>Kashi Venkatesh Vishwanath</strong></a> allowed to redistribute the code, according to its <a href="LICENSE"><strong>LICENCE</strong></a> I decided publish it here, so anyone can use this tool.</p>

<p>The original readme file, with a quick introduction, can be found <a href="README"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>If you use <strong>Swingxficgenerator</strong> in any work, please, cite the original paper. I also recomment the reading for a deeper undertanding of the tool.</p>
