<p>
	<b>EtherMonitor</b> is an application developed in C and implemented for an LTE radio base station, called eNodeB developed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpqd.com.br/releases/cpqd-apresenta-tecnologia-lte4g-na-faixa-de-700-mhz/">CPQD Foundation's LTE/4G project</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<b>eNodeB</b> is the radio base station responsible for data transmission using LTE technology, used by internet providers to offer 4G services. Physically, the <b>eNodeB</b> has several ethernet network cables responsible for connecting it to the cloud.

</p>

<p> 
	In the implementation developed by CPQD, at any given time, only one of them will be operational, and the other backup cables. If any of its interfaces fail, EtherMonitor is responsible for disabling this interface, and reconfiguring the next backup interface with all configurations and IPv4 address of the disconnected interface. In this way, EtherMonitor ensures that: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>eNodeB </b> will lose cloud access and control only if all interfaces fail.
	</li>

	<li>
		For the cloud and the operator it is completely transparent that any hardware or software failure has occurred in one of the network interfaces, as the backup interface configuration is automatic.
	</li>

	<li>
		The operator may still be aware that any of the interfaces failed through the <b>eNodeB</b> command line interface, and may take the necessary measures. <b>EtherMonitor</b> must ensure that the correct information about the physical interface used is available.
	</li>

</ul>
