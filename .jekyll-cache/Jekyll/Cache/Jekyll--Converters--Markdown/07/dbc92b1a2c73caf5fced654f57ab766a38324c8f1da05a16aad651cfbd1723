<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: New emerging technologies have a larger unpredictability, compared to legacy equipment. They
require a larger set of meaningful tests on many different scenarios. But, in the open source world is hard to find
a single tool able to provide realism, speed, easy usage and flexibility at the same time. Most of the tools are
monolithic and devoted to specific purposes. This work presents a flexible and extensible framework which aims
to decouple synthetic traffic modelling from its traffic generator engine. Through a new abstraction layer, it would
become possible to use modern and throughput optimized tools to create realistic traffic, in an automated way. This
enables a platform agnostic configuration and reproduction of complex scenarios via analytical models. Also we use
pcap files and live-capture to create “Compact Trace Descriptors”.</p>
