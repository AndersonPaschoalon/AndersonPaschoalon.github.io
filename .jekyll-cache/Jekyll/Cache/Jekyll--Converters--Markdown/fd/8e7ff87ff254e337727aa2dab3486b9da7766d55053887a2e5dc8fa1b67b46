<p>Some small mods I developed for Age Of Mitology. Right now I have seven random maps, and one Campaing with five scenarios (in development).</p>

<h3 id="random-maps">Random Maps</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Arabian Desert</strong>: A large desert with hidden treasures and bandit camps and scarse wood.</li>
  <li><strong>Elysius Camps</strong>: A miraculous and brilliant land, with plenty of resources available, but you will have to fight for it.</li>
  <li><strong>Guardians A</strong>: Each player starts with a Guardian in the Valley of the Kings.</li>
  <li><strong>Guardians B</strong>: Each player starts with a Guardian in a Savanna megalopolis.</li>
  <li><strong>One Settlement</strong>: All players start with one settlement and some small villages. But there are no other settlements available.</li>
  <li><strong>Ragnarock</strong>: A Battle Royale among the gods in a nordic apocalyptic World.</li>
  <li><strong>Sahara Desert</strong>: All resources are hard to be found in this map, especially wood.</li>
</ul>
