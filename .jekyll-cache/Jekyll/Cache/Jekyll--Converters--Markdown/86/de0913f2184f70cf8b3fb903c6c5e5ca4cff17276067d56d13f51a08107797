<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this work, we aim to evaluate how good are the information criteria AIC and BIC inferring which
is the best stochastic process to describe Ethernet inter-packet times. Also, we check if there is a practical difference
between using AIC or BIC. We use a set of stochastic distributions to represent inter-packet of a traffic trace and calculate AIC and BIC. To test the quality of BIC and AIC guesses, we define a cost function based on the comparison
of significant stochastic properties for internet traffic modeling, such as correlation, fractal-level and mean. Then,
we compare both results. In this short paper, we present just the results of a public free Skype-application packet
capture, but we provide as reference further analyzes on different traffic traces. We conclude that for most cases AIC
and BIC can guess right the best fitting according to the standards of Ethernet traffic modeling.</p>
