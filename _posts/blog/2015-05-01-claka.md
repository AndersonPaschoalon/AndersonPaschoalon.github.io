# Introduction to CL-AKA Protocols

**Abstract**: The use of digital certificates distributed by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the most widespread methodology in symmetric key agreement protocols. In this work, some alternative methodologies will be discussed, with a greater focus on CL-AKA protocols, ie, authenticated key agreement protocols without the use of certificates. The theoretical foundations, two protocol implementations, and some practical applications and proposals will be discussed.
