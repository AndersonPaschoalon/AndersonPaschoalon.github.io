# Mod Pack for Age of Mitology


Some small mods I developed for Age Of Mitology. Right now I have seven random maps, and one Campaing with five scenarios (in development).

### Random Maps

 - **Arabian Desert**: A large desert with hidden treasures and bandit camps and scarse wood.
 - **Elysius Camps**: A miraculous and brilliant land, with plenty of resources available, but you will have to fight for it.
 - **Guardians A**: Each player starts with a Guardian in the Valley of the Kings.
 - **Guardians B**: Each player starts with a Guardian in a Savanna megalopolis.
 - **One Settlement**: All players start with one settlement and some small villages. But there are no other settlements available.
 - **Ragnarock**: A Battle Royale among the gods in a nordic apocalyptic World.
 - **Sahara Desert**: All resources are hard to be found in this map, especially wood.
