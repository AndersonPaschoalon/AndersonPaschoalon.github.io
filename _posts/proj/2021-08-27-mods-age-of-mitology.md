# The Lost Continent of Adria


_In the mythical continent of Adria, a fantastic and magical land there is a permanent conflict between all the human and beast races that inhabit that land._

_You will have the mission to lead the Nords, a human race that lives in the snowy mountains and pine forests of the north through a journey to conquer the world._

_You will travel through deserts, forests, mountains, volcanos, and forests, full of secrets, animals, and mythical creatures._

### Random Maps

 - **Arabian Desert**: A large desert with hidden treasures and bandit camps and scarse wood.
 - **Elysius Camps**: A miraculous and brilliant land, with plenty of resources available, but you will have to fight for it.
 - **Guardians A**: Each player starts with a Guardian in the Valley of the Kings.
 - **Guardians B**: Each player starts with a Guardian in a Savanna megalopolis.
 - **One Settlement**: All players start with one settlement and some small villages. But there are no other settlements available.
 - **Ragnarock**: A Battle Royale among the gods in a nordic apocalyptic World.
 - **Sahara Desert**: All resources are hard to be found in this map, especially wood.
