_In the mythical continent of Adria, a fantastic and magical land there is a permanent conflict between all the human and beast races that inhabit that land._

_You will have the mission to lead the Nords, a human race that lives in the snowy mountains and pine forests of the north through a journey to conquer the world._

_You will travel through deserts, forests, mountains, volcanos, and forests, full of secrets, animals, and mythical creatures._

# About this Mod

## Main Campaign

<p align="center">
	<img src="./assets/img/posts/aom/Adria.jpg" width="600" >
</p>

This mod brings a new Campaign with RPG-like lore and a collection of new random maps for Age of Mythology.

My idea behind the Campaign is to combine some new concepts:

* Create a new mechanic (more "realistic") where you can't create new unity between each quest. You will receive new units after each quest, but you cannot spawn new units on each of them. Every unity is precious, and you have to use them wisely.

* This is not a "mythological reality", but an RPG-like fantasy world, such as Dungeons and Dragons, and The Elder Scrolls. You will have a continent to explore, and many races, some humans, some not. But you are going to control armies, not a character. 

* The Campaign is composed of 5 quest, each one happening in a different part of the world.


The Lost Continent of Adria has six major regions, each one of which is inhabited by one different race:

* **Nordic Taiga**: the northern region of the continent, the homeland of the Nords and the Dwarves. If full of snowy mountains and pine forests. Their capital is hidden on a hill in the middle of the forest. The wildlife is composed mainly of deer, bears, and wolves.

* **Central Desert**: homeland of the Bedouins, the Central desert is a harsh land with few trees and dry weather.  But the land is rich in minerals, and some oases with palm trees and fish can be found. The Bedouin's capital is the have the stronger fortifications on the whole continent.

</p>


* **South Savannah**: homeland of the Werejackals, is a vast savannah with plenty of natural resources. Their capital is a farm city close to the sea. The wildlife is composed of savannah animals like Giraffes, Gazelles, and Lions, but also by fearsome Nemea Lions.

* **Rock Valey**: The most mysterious and secluded land of the continent. It is a misty land surrounded by the western sea and the fire mountains at the east. Dense fogs fill its pine-dark forest, and the wildlife is mostly composed of mysterious mythical creatures. Its wildlife includes giant scrabs, flying serpents,  walking trees, manticores, chimeras, and dragons.  This is the homeland of the Trolls. Each clan leader of each settlement wons a pet, a faithful beast from the wilds.

* **Oak Forest**: An oak forest surrounded in the west by the Rock Mountains. It is inhabited by the Cyclops, the stronger race of the continent. They have only one main city close to the sea and the Savannah. The wildlife is composed mainly by deer and boars.

* **Palm Isthmus**: A small portion of land in the south, inhabited by the Cretans. They are fewer in number but have the stronger navy army on the continent. In the forest, dryads can be found, and in the sea Krakens, Leviathans, Carcinos, and Wales can be seen.
