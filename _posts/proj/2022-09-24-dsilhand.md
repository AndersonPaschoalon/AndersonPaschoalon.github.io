_For centuries the Daedric Wolves lived among the sons of Skyrim in secret._

_But no one wanted to believe._
_Or had the strength to fight._

_Now it is up to YOU to choose which side will prevail._

_The Beast Blood... Or the Silver Hands!_


## Overview

This mod allow you to join the Silver Hand faction!

It is up to you to decide! You can still follow the vanilla path joining The Companions, but this mod allow you to see an alternate timeline where the Dragonborn joins the Silver Hand instead!


I am really grateful for all the positive comments and good reception of this mod. 

It has already received some reviews from the portal *THE GAMER*, and the youtube player *yerak*:

**Dragonborn as a Silver Hand!**

This mod tries to imagine how would be the sequence of facts if he decided to join the Silver Hands instead. It is not a simple mod with some bounty quests. It has a full story-line that tries to follows the same sequence of facts you see in The Companions quest-line, but from the Silver Hands perspective:

* Find the missing pieces of Wuulthad!
* Work in the shadows to dismantle The Companions plans!
* **Defend Gallows Rock** from Companions invasion, and **attack Jorrvaskr**!
* Reassemble the legendary Axe Wuuthrad!

The amount of content added by this mod is similar in therms of game-play with The Companions content, alongside with **two new Silver Hand's locations** and a new **Player House**.

**Improoved Experience**

A new **soundtrack** is added to both factions, to reflect the moods of The Companions and The Silver Hands. The Companions have a glorious, urban and bard-sh mood, to reflect their proud. The Silver Hands have a darker and wild-sh and seclude soundtrack, reflecting they are isolated in the wilds.

If you join the Silver Hands, new content will be available:

* Acquire a new house in Gallows Rock;
* Two new followers;
* Forge and Upgrade Silver Weapons, and learn to forge stronger type of Silver Sword;
* New unique weapons and armours;
* 5 new radiant quests to allow a limitless game-play content for the faction.


## Lore


This mod tries to be as lore-friendly as possible. Since not much is explicitly said about the Silver Hands the the series, some speculations exercises are made. 

I started to write the story for this mod before FudgeMuppet released their video about the Silver Hands. The funny thing is some of his conclusions about the past of the Silver Hands are mine as well.

I highly recommend you to watch his video before playing my mod:

Some assumptions I took about the past of the Silver Hands are:

* They were formed as a dissident group of The Companions after Terrfyg (https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Terrfyg) made the pact with the Glenmoril Witches (https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Glenmoril_Witches). They are called "dissidents" by Kodlak and Vignar.

* The Silver Hands are very devoted to the Ysgramor legacy, and they see themselves as the true holders of his legacy in Skyrim.

* The Silver Hands are a recluse faction, but keep relationships with farmers, villagers and some Jarls.

* In the start of the game the Silver Hands have the possession of four fragments of Wuulthrad, the same number of fragments The Companions have. They were searching for the fragments since their foundation.
