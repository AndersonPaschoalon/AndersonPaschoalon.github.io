# Nexus Build App

Nexus Packager App is a command-line tool for automating the packaging process of Nexus mods.

I create this app because I wanted a flexible and simple tool to package both my Skyrim and Age of Mythology mods.

This application:

* Package files defined by rules into a ZIP, and preserve its original directory structure;
* Scriptable rules, write once, so you will never forget any files;
* Creates an uninstall script.
